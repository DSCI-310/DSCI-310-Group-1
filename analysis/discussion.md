Using the 9 features we presented above, we were able to create a linear regression model with an RMSE error of [3.83]
. Given the scale of the target variable (G3) is 0-20, we find that this error is very high; therefore, we find that using features predominately consisting on demographic and social factors would not lend itself well to accurately predicting grade. This high error can be seen in our regression graph, where the predictions seem to be consistent in the 5-13 range no matter what the true grade of the student is. This can be interpreted as a positive outcome, as it suggests that your performance in school is only mildly impacted by demographic (e.g. parent job) and social (e.g. romantic) factors, which means more emphasis is likely placed on how much effort you apply to the course.

When examining the coefficients, this does reflect some of the finding found by Pritchard & Wilson [{cite:year}`ESfactors`], as they found that parent's education seemed to be one of the most influential factors in predicting high grades as we see that mother's education is the third highest predictor of high grades. On the other hand, we see that this is only true of the mother's education, since the father's education level seems to be quite unimpactful. It is interesting to see how much influence the mother has when compared to the father. Given that we do not see coefficients regarding the father much in these top 5 or bottom 5 coefficients, we can say that the father doesn't have much of an impact at all unless he happens to work as a teacher. Lastly, we expected goout and romantic to have a negative correlation with your final grade as you are likely to be spending your time with your peers rather than studying. This expectation was reflected strongly in the analysis.

A future question we could ask using this dataset is how effective pure academic features such as study time and number of classes failed perform when trying to predict final grade. We see that study time, while we intuitively thought would have a major positive correlation with high grades, is only the 5th highest coefficient. This suggests that it is quite possible that demographic and social factors may have a higher impact than we see from this report, such that it is absolutely required that we look at social, demographic, and academic factors at the same time. Is academic factors dominant in predicting grade or does demographic and social factors have a higher impact than it seems?
